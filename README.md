# Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Project Details
In this project, I will use the data of bike sharing system provided for 3 large cities in the United States (Chicago, New York and Washington), to uncover bike share usage patterns. 

With **Python** I will compute a variety of descriptive statistics, to provide the following information:
* Popular times of travel 
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration
* User info

I will build interactive user experience as based on raw data file and user input to tree main questions differnet statiscics will be displayed.
* Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington? 
* Which month - January, February, March, April, May, June or all?
* Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday or all?

### Software needs
You should have:
* Python 3
* A text editor, like Atom.
* A terminal application (Git Bash on Windows).

### Used Python libraries
* NumPy
* Pandas 

## Files used
City raw dataset files (excluded with .gitignore as files are too big)
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
